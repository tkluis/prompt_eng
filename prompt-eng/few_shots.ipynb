      "2. Integration with third-party software applications: The system will need to integrate with several existing systems, such as CRM, ERP, and accounting software.\n",
      "3. Data import/export capabilities: Users should be able to easily import and export data from the system.\n",
      "4. Customization options: Users should have the ability to customize various aspects of the system, such as dashboards, reports, and workflows.\n",

Users will be able to create profiles, join groups based on common interests, participate in discussions and engage with other like-minded individuals.\n",

      "2. Users shall be able to search for other users based on profile information.\n",
      "3. The system shall enable users to create and manage connections (i.e., follow or friend) with other users.\n",
      "4. The system shall provide a news feed that displays updates from the users' connections in reverse chronological order, including text, images, and videos.\n",
      "5. The system shall include a search functionality that allows users to find specific content based on keywords.\n",

      "1. The application will run on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.\n",
      "2. The user interface (UI) must be highly responsive and should not require more than 2 seconds of loading time.\n",
      "3. The UI should be accessible to users with disabilities.\n",
      "4. The application should have the ability to store data in a relational database management system.\n",
      "5. The application will require a minimum of 3 APIs that will need to integrate with each other seamlessly.\n",
      "6. The application must have robust security features to ensure sensitive information is protected.\n",
