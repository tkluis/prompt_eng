# Experimenting with Prompt Engineering Techniques

Hereâ€™s a list of ideas for research and experiments with Prompt Engineering techniques that we would like to incorporate into the lab:

1. Experimenting with different prompt templates across use cases to achieve the highest accuracy.
2. Enhancing or completing existing code for Prompt Engineering techniques to support new use cases.
3. Developing new code for additional Prompt Engineering techniques.
4. Conducting experiments with combinations of automated prompt generation in a chained process.
5. Testing combinations of Prompt Engineering techniques, automated prompt generation, and model parameter variations to determine the best balance between latency and accuracy.

### Outcomes

* **High-quality code** and **well-defined use cases** will be considered for integration into the Prompt Engineering Lab.


# Contributing to Research

If youâ€™d like to contribute a research report describing the results of your exploration, please use the template provided here:  
[Research Report Template](./MY-REPORT.md)

### Outcomes 

* **High-quality research reports** may be invited for inclusion in internal publications.  
* **Exceptional research reports** could be expanded for submission to external publications or conferences. Reports should include:
    * Experiments that generate data to support comparative analyses of different methods, techniques, and parameter variations.
    * Clear visual representations, such as diagrams and graphs, that effectively communicate experimental processes and results.


# Contributing to the Core Code

This is an experimental and educational project. As such, we are "building it as we fly it," and issues or deficiencies within the CORE Code are expected.

Please check the [ISSUES](https://github.com/genilab-fau/prompt-eng/issues) section for known problems where you can contribute. If you discover an issue, comment on that thread to be assigned.

If you have an enhancement request or an idea for improvement, please reach out through [ISSUES](https://github.com/genilab-fau/prompt-eng/issues). You can either create a [NEW ISSUE](https://github.com/genilab-fau/prompt-eng/issues) or contact us via email.
